Project Overview:
The project is a service management system designed to facilitate interactions between users (clients) and contractors who provide various services.

User Roles:
Users (Clients):

Users can create accounts and log in.
They can schedule appointments with contractors.
They provide personal details like name, email, phone number, and address during the appointment booking process.
Users can manage their own profiles and view appointment statuses.
Contractors:

Contractors can register and manage their profiles.
They may have specific details like gender, Aadhar ID, and location.
Contractors offer services to users, which can be selected during appointment scheduling.
They might be responsible for fulfilling the appointments set by users.
Key Functionalities:
Appointment Booking: Users can book appointments by providing necessary details, which are stored in the system.
Contractor Management: The system keeps track of contractor information, making it easy for users to find and select contractors based on their needs.
Service Selection: Users can choose from various services offered by contractors during the appointment scheduling process.
User Authentication: The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication, ensuring that only registered users can access their accounts.





















Steps for a User to Book an Appointment:
User Registration/Login:

Register: If you're a new user, you would fill out a registration form with details like your name, email, phone number, and other relevant information.
Login: If you're already registered, you would log in using your credentials (email and password).
Select Service:

After logging in, you would navigate to a section of the application that lists available services offered by contractors. This could be represented as a menu or a dedicated page.
Fill Appointment Form:

Once you choose a service, you would be directed to an appointment form. The fields to fill in may include:
First Name: Your first name.
Last Name: Your last name.
Email: Your email address for confirmation.
Phone Number: Your contact number.
Address Information: This includes fields for street address, city, state, and ZIP code.
Preferred Working Time: You might select your preferred time for the service.
Type of Work: Specify the type of service needed.
Additional Notes: Any specific requests or information relevant to the appointment.
Submit Appointment:

After filling out the form, you would submit it, typically by clicking a "Book Appointment" button.
Confirmation:

Upon successful submission, the system would save your appointment details in the database.
You would likely receive a confirmation email or notification indicating that your appointment has been booked successfully.
Manage Appointments:

After booking, you can view your appointments through your user account. This section would allow you to see upcoming appointments and provide options to cancel or reschedule if necessary.
Example Flow:
You log in → Select a service (e.g., plumbing) → Fill out the appointment form → Submit the form → Receive confirmation.
This workflow, as represented in your code structure, guides the user through a straightforward process to book appointments with contractors for various services.










Based on the code structure provided, it's not explicitly clear if the application is set up to automatically send a confirmation to the contractor when an appointment is scheduled












You're right; if contractors are not notified when an appointment is scheduled, it can be a significant drawback for both the user and the contractor. To implement a notification system for contractors in your Spring Boot application, here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. **Define Notification Logic**
   You need to create a service that will handle the notification to contractors when an appointment is created.

#### 2. **Add Email Service**
   First, ensure you have an email service set up. You can use Spring Boot's built-in support for sending emails through `JavaMailSender`.

#### 3. **Modify the Appointment Service**
   You'll need to modify the existing appointment service to send notifications after an appointment is successfully created.

### Specific Steps in Code

1. **Create a Notification Service**
   Create a new service class, `NotificationService`, to handle sending notifications.

   ```java
   package com.themes.services;

   import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
   import org.springframework.mail.SimpleMailMessage;
   import org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSender;
   import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

   @Service
   public class NotificationService {
       @Autowired
       private JavaMailSender emailSender;

       public void sendAppointmentNotification(String contractorEmail, String appointmentDetails) {
           SimpleMailMessage message = new SimpleMailMessage();
           message.setTo(contractorEmail);
           message.setSubject("New Appointment Scheduled");
           message.setText(appointmentDetails);
           emailSender.send(message);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Modify Appointment Creation Logic**
   In the service where appointments are created (likely in `AppointmentService`), add logic to send the notification to the contractor.

   ```java
   @Autowired
   private NotificationService notificationService;

   public Appointment createAppointment(Appointment appointment) {
       // Save the appointment to the database
       Appointment savedAppointment = appointmentRepository.save(appointment);

       // Prepare appointment details for notification
       String contractorEmail = getContractorEmail(appointment.getaUserId()); // Assuming you have a way to get contractor email
       String appointmentDetails = "Appointment scheduled for " + savedAppointment.getaFirstname() + 
                                    " on " + savedAppointment.getCreatedDate() +
                                    " at " + savedAppointment.getaWorkingTime();
       
       // Send notification to the contractor
       notificationService.sendAppointmentNotification(contractorEmail, appointmentDetails);
       
       return savedAppointment;
   }
   ```

3. **Retrieve Contractor Email**
   You need to implement `getContractorEmail` method. This method should query your database for the contractor's email based on the user ID or some association with the appointment.

   ```java
   private String getContractorEmail(Integer userId) {
       // Implement logic to retrieve contractor's email based on userId
       // This could involve querying a ContractorDetails repository
       ContractorDetails contractor = contractorRepository.findByUserId(userId);
       return contractor != null ? contractor.getEmail() : null;
   }
   ```

4. **Configure Email Properties**
   Ensure you have your email configuration set up in `application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.mail.host=smtp.example.com
   spring.mail.port=587
   spring.mail.username=your-email@example.com
   spring.mail.password=your-email-password
   spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
   spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
   ```

### Final Steps
- **Test the Implementation**: After coding, test the appointment booking process to ensure that contractors receive emails as expected.
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling in case the email sending fails.

### Summary
With these modifications, whenever a user schedules an appointment, the corresponding contractor will receive a notification via email, thereby improving communication and ensuring both parties are informed.
